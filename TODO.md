- build script to set up initial system
  - prompt for root password, hostname, etc
- MBR support
- live USB image others can use to bootstrap initial install on thumb drive
  - so we can support users not already starting from Linux...
  - helper scripts to set up common drivers (nvidia/wireless etc)
- Where to store/sync /home? could be another partition on thumb drive, or ramdisk sync to cloud storage
- rewrite everything as ansible playbooks?
- maybe some configs for various kinds of local storage (e.g. we could keep a persistent Steam library,downloads/home folder on an SSD, etc)
- figure out kernel package update workflow. Syslinux.cfg needs to get updated
- automating creation of GUID partition table?
- need way of templating/generating syslinux.cfg..ansible starting to look like an ok job for this too
